# Objective
This project tries to predict the emotion of the user based on how he/she speaks in realtime and can also be used to predict emotion of a recorded audio file.
We have used standard Machine Learning (ML) model for this prediction.

# Highlights
1) Used librosa (a python package) for numerical audio feature extraction and visualization. 
3) Implemented an end to end machine learning pipeline.

5) Compared performance of various models used for prediction.
6) Deployed the pipeline on streamlit (a web interface).
